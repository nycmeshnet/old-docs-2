Make coffee or tea as it takes 5 minutes or more to finish configuring. Obviously, do not unplug the power while it is doing this configuring.

When you have finished your beverage, you should now be able use the router by connecting the blue ethernet WAN port to LAN port of another router. If you are in the same location as another NYC Mesh router you will already be meshed. Your new router automatically contacts NYC Mesh and we add it to our list of nodes, usually within the hour or first thing in the morning. Once added you will be able to see our local servers http://ev.mesh, http://bayridge.mesh/ and http://harlem.mesh/

These local servers are only visible on the mesh. If you see one of these servers then congratulations, you are on the mesh.
