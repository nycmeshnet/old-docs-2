Thanks for filling out the node request form. What directions, and how far can you see from the roof? 

We currently support two different types of routers. A long distance directional router, the Ubiquiti Nanostation NSM5. (~$90) and a small indoor TP-Link router for twenty eight dollars. You can buy a pre-configured router from us.

For rooftops, we configure the NanoStations with mesh software and can help you with the installation. Typically one or two routers are attached to a pole on the roof and an ethernet cable is run to the apartment, and connected to an internet gateway and perhaps another TP-Link mesh router.

If you don't have rooftop access it is still possible to use a directional NanoStation in your window. This works best with line-of-sight to another router. It will work from behind glass if you are unable to place it outside the window.

If your router is within range of another mesh router it will automatically connect to the mesh. If you are out of range, then the router will connect to the mesh over the internet (tunneling). Either way you will be part of the mesh and be able to see our local server at http://nyc.mesh/ (our local server is only available if you are on the mesh)
