Flashing Ubiquiti
Connect Ubiquiti to laptop (it has no wifi to begin with)

Go to 192.168.1.20
name: ubnt
pwd: ubnt


Flash with qMp factory image-

for Nanostation M5 XW get the trunk factory image here-
http://fw.guifibaix.coop/

For TPLink WR-842ND and WR-841Nv9 get the image here-
https://github.com/nycmeshnet/firmware
(these images have GRE tunneling)

For other routers get the "factory" images here-
http://fw.qmp.cat/stable/

"factory" is for flashing from the original firmware. "sysupdate" is for flashing after qMp or OpenWRT is installed.


After it reboots go to-
admin.qmp
or 
172.30.22.1
name: root
pwd: 13f

Change from "roaming" to "community"

Change node name to abbreviated location e.g. BkPkSlope

Write down the IP on the router (10.30.x.1) (You can actually use any IP range in 10.x.x.1)

Check that Wireless interface wlan0 is set to-
 Ad hoc (mesh) + access point

<submit>

After reboot go to the IP you wrote down

Log into Luci and scroll to the bottom and click "Administration"

In the Status menu scroll down to
SSID: qMp-AP
click on this and edit the ESSID to say-
nycmesh mylocation

<Save & Apply>

After reboot log back in and change the Administration password.

Beware that saving anything in the "qMp" menu will overwrite a lot of things including the SSID

Add the splash page by following instructions here:
https://github.com/nycmeshnet/nodogsplash

The DNS tld should be changed to .mesh and .mesh6?  That's the only way we can see nyc.mesh from the network.
